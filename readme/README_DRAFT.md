### Rock Paper Scissors - Small Bigger Biggest. 
### Aka. The enemy of my enemy is my food.

The size advantage we've created is constant no matter what the difference in size. If one organism is a little bigger than a competitor it benefits the same as if it were a lot bigger. However, the reproductive advantage of smaller organisms varies proportionately to size. The smaller the organism the quicker it is to make copies of itself. The result is that a colony of a much bigger organism will collapse when in contact with colony of a smaller organism -- unless it evolves. Larger organisms must develop an inherent advantage over much smaller organisms to survive. And they do, to a point.

The relationship between small, bigger, and biggest is remeniscent of rock paper scissors. Interestingly this kind of [Cyclic cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_cellular_automaton) has been studied by David Griffeath and is illustrated well in this video [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4cV0nCIZoc).

What's really interesting is that there is a stability present with 3 types or organisms that have a cycle of dominance that isn't present with just 2 organisms. This tendency to maintain a mixes state may eventually leed to mutually co-existing species, and even structures reminiscent of cell walls.

### Working well vs. looking good (draft)

Sometimes it makes sense to sacrifice the effectiveness of our evolutionary model to something that that looks more appealing.
- Adding an extra step when sprouting seeds.
- Displaying results on a bounded board vs. a torus. The boandaries make the movement of organisms easier to follow without them crawling and reappearing on the other side of the screen.
 
### The chaos at the top (draft)

The longer the lifespan of the individual, the more likely it is to produce more offspring. This is usually counterbalanced by organisms wanting to be small, but it can become an issue. For this reason we add a maximum lifespan setting as a limit on the maximum self-destruct lifespan of organisms to prevent run away growth should it arise.

### The search for mutual co-existance (draft)

An open problem is to find co-existing species. Complexity in nature often arises through collaboration, as in the case of mitochondria.
