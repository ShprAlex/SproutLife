Sprout Life adds reproduction, mutation, and evolution to Conway’s Game of Life. It's a unique solution that bridges a gap between cellular automata and evolutionary algorithms. Cellular automata were invented to model self-replicating machines [1], but these machines have mostly [2] been too fragile to survive mutation and evolve.

Sprout Life simplifies the process of reproduction by keeping the "dna" of the organism in memory. To reproduce a cellular automaton performs an easier, though non-trivial task of making seed shapes. The seeds sprout new children which inherit the dna from their parent. Reproduction is the defining process that organisms perform over a lifetime. Its simpler nature makes it resilient to mutation, and the fact that it's non-trivial allows it to undergo evolution.

Organisms collide with each other and disrupt each other's ability to produce seeds. The pressures of producing seeds and competing with other organisms can lead them to evolve to an unlimited complexity. As it turns out, managing collisions with both friends and foes has a greater impact on an organism's success than simply being faster to create offspring.
