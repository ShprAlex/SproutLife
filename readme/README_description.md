Sprout Life is a model of evolution towards greater complexity that builds on Conway’s Game of Life. GOL is famous for having self-organizing patterns with lifelike behaviors emerge from simple rules. We take this emergence a step further. Sprout Life treats patterns like organisms, allowing them to reproduce, mutate, and evolve.

From their evolution we can see that there is a trade-off between individual benefit and collective stability. Paradoxically, it turns out that greater reproductive ability and longer lifespan do not always help an organism and its descendants to thrive.
