Sprout Life is a model for the evolution of complex life. It extends Conway’s Game of Life, which is famous for having lifelike patterns emerge from simple rules. Sprout Life takes this emergence a step further, creating patterns that reproduce, mutate, and evolve.

Enabling reproduction leads to the spontaneous emergence of more advanced behaviors. Organisms begin to compete for space and align in battle formations with their siblings. Sprout Life seems to achieve "open ended evolution" -- which is a sought after result in artificial life. This requires more rigorous analysis to verify. Game of Life is Turing complete, so there is no limit to how complex the evolved behavior can get.

For now you can watch evolution happen by running Sprout Life on your desktop. In future versions it could be fun to enable web-based competitions between organisms collected by multiple users.
