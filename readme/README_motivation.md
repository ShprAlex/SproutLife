### Motivation

There are several reasons why Sprout Life is exciting:

- **Open ended evolution** - Sprout Life allows for truly open ended evolution. We want to emulate the rise of biological complexity. We start with atoms, which in the world of cellular automata are pixels on a grid. GOL defines a digital chemistry that governs these atoms. Sprout Life makes the chemicals behave more like biological molecules. The computer simulates the physics of these atoms, chemicals, and bio-molecules. The result is building blocks which interact to form self-sustaining structures. We want an environment where bigger and better structures can continuously emerge, and that's what we believe we've been able to do with Sprout Life.

- **Collective behavior, not just individual fitness** - Collective behavior is the driver for evolution within Sprout Life. Cellular automata patterns are fragile and sensitive to disruption. In order for an organism to succeed it needs to be a good neighbor to its offspring, parents, and relatives.

- **A rich source of metaphor** - A better model of collective evolution is a rich source of metaphor. Beyond biology, there are strong parallels between the success of new mutations, and the success of new ideas in the startup world. Potentially even phenomena like political revolutions or the boom and bust cycles of the stock market can have light shed upon them by modelling the ebb and flow of evolution.

- **Made for speed** - Speed is of the essence in simulating evolution. The ideal is to have a beautiful story unfold in real time. Cellular automata are perfectly designed for rapid computation by computers. Getting the next state of the game is almost like adding together two binary numbers. This is what computers were made to do. With the computer as our vehicle, we can explore the evolving world of cellular automata and learn from our discoveries.
